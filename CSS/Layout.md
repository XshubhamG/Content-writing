# Layouts

## Day 1 [Using % and avoiding heights]

- flex,
- grid,
- viewport units (vw & vh)

## Day 2 [Relative units]

- relative units (em & rem)
- Always use `rem` for `font-size` or `margin` since it give us the relative size to root which makes
  it easier to make things with equal spacing between elments.
- Always use `em` for `padding` or `border` since it give the proper relative size or space according to the
  current element's `font-size` (ex: button).

## Day 3 [max-width]
